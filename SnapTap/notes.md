    When you press and hold down the "A" key, SnapKey remembers it.
    If you then press the "D" key while still holding down "A" SnapKey automatically releases the "A" key for you.
    The same happens if you press "A" while holding "D" — SnapKey releases the "D" key.

SnapKey prevents simultaneous movement key conflicts (AD / WS)

    In many FPS games, pressing both the "A" and "D" keys simultaneously typically results in the game recognizing conflicting inputs. SnapKey automatically releases the previously held key when a new key input is detected.
    The keys are separated into two different groups: A/D and W/S. In each group, "A" cancels out "D" and vice versa, while the same applies to "W" and "S". These groups do not interfere with each other and work separately.

Sticky Keys

    Sticky Keys is a feature that keeps track of the state of a key you've pressed down. For example, if you hold down the "A" key and tap the "D" key repeatedly, each press of "D" will temporarily override the "A" key. When you release the "D" key, the action associated with the "A" key will resume, as long as you're still holding it down. The same principle applies if you start with "D" held down and press "A" instead.
