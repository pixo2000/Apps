Game idee: 3d sternsystem man kann in nem schiff rumfliegen zu stationen, so wie galaxy in elite. so 3d space aus 0 und 1, 1 feld braucht 1 sprungreichweite und 5s?



init prompt:
create a game in python. remember to split files into main, visual, player etc.

The game: a 3d space game(coordinate system), you move the camera like this: A/D to rotate, W/S to move foreward/backwards, X/Y to zoom and R/F to go up and down.

when you press G the player is centerd. there are some stations generated randomly in the system. you can go to them by selecting them with SPACE, once you zoomed to them. every coordinate you move takes 1 second
