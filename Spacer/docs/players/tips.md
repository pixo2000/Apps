# Tips & Tricks

This page contains helpful advice to enhance your Spacer experience.

## Navigation Tips

- **Optimal Movement**: Since diagonal movement takes the same time as horizontal or vertical (Chebyshev distance), moving diagonally is more efficient for covering distance.

- **Planning Routes**: When planning to visit multiple bodies, try to create an efficient path that minimizes total travel time.

- **Danger Zones**: Avoid moving onto stars - they are hazardous and could potentially end your journey.

## Exploration Tips

- **Initial Scan**: Always perform a `scan` immediately after jumping to a new dimension to get a map of the system.

- **Unknown Bodies**: Bodies showing as "Unknown" are beyond your scanner's 60-unit identification range. Move closer to identify them.

- **Signal Focus**: Bodies with higher signal counts have more moons or stations. Prioritize exploring these for more discoveries.

- **Systematic Exploration**: For completionists, work through systems methodically to ensure you discover all celestial bodies.

## Game Management Tips

- **Player Names**: Choose distinctive names that meet the 3-15 character requirement and contain only letters, numbers, and underscores.

- **Save Management**: The game auto-saves after each command, but it's good practice to use `logout` when taking extended breaks.

- **Multiple Captains**: You can create multiple captains to have different exploration journeys. Use `logout` to switch between them.

- **Player Lookup**: Use `playerinfo PLAYERNAME` to check the progress of other captains.

## General Advice

- **Dimension Tracking**: Use `discoveries` regularly to keep track of which dimensions you've visited and what you've found.

- **Avoid Self-Destruct**: The `self-destruct` command permanently ends your captain's journey - use with extreme caution!

- **Backup Captains**: Consider creating a backup captain in case something happens to your main one.

- **Help Command**: When in doubt, use the `help` command to see all available actions.

## Advanced Strategy

- **Discovery Efficiency**: For efficient exploration, try to position yourself so that your 60-unit scan radius covers as many unknown bodies as possible.

- **Dimension Completion**: Before moving to a new dimension, try to discover all bodies in your current one for completionist satisfaction.

- **Session Planning**: For longer play sessions, plan a route through multiple dimensions to maximize your discoveries.

Remember, Spacer is about the journey of exploration - take your time and enjoy charting the cosmos!
